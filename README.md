# flappy-bird-AI
This flappy bird AI has been coded using the neat library in python which uses reinforcement learning .

At the starting 15 birds(this number depends on the user which he/she can specify) are there which play randomly.

The bird which is able to score the highest is allowed to reproduce in this way the birds learn very quickly how to play the game .

The neat library takes the horizontal distance from the pipe and vertical distance from the open passage into consideration for calculations.
